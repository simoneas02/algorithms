## D&C| Divider & conquer

D&C gives you a new way to think about solving problems. D&C algorithms are recursive algorithms. There are two steps to solve a problem using it:

- Figure out the base case. This should be the simplest possible case.
- Divide or decrease your problem until it becomes the base case.

## Remember recursion

> When you're writing a recursive function involving an array, the base case is often an empty array or an array with one element. If you're stuck, try that first.
