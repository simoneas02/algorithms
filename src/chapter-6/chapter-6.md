## Breadth-first search(BFS)

BFS allows you to find the shortest distance between two things. Shortest-path- problem: you're always trying to find the shortest something. The algorithm to solve shortest-path problem is called breadth-first search. BFS not only finds a path from A to B, it also finds the shortest path.

## What's a graph?

A graph models a set of connections. Graphs are made up of nodes and edges. A node can be directly connected to many other nodes. Graphs are a way to model how different things are connected to one another.

- A tree is a special type of graph, where no edges ever point back.
- Queues are FIFO(First In,First Out)
- Stacks are lIFO(Last In,First Out)
