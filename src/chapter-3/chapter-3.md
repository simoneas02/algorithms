## Recursion

Recursion is a coding technique used in many algorithms where a function calls itself. There is no performance benefit to using recursion, in fact, loops are sometimes better for performance.

> Loops may achieve a performance gain for you program. Recursions may achieve a performance gain for you programmer. Choose which is more importantin your situation. " - Leigh Caldwell"

When you write a recursive function, you have to tell it when to stop recursing

## The call stack

The stack is a simple data structure. The call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program.

## Example

- [Countdown](./code/countdown.js)
- [factorial](./code/factorial.js)
